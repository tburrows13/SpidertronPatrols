sp-spidertron-patrols=An overview of the main features added by [font=default-bold]Spidertron Patrols[/font].\n\nIf the schedule GUI doesn't fit on your screen, consider decreasing [font=default-semibold]UI scale[/font] or disabling [font=default-semibold]Flat character GUI[/font] in Settings > Interface.
sp-dock=[entity=sp-spidertron-dock] allows for the automated loading and unloading of spidertrons using inserters. A dock automatically connects to the first spidertron that stops over it and disconnects when the spidertron walks away.
sp-spidertron-automation=Obtain [item=sp-spidertron-patrol-remote] from the panel on the right-hand side of the spidertron's GUI or by pressing __CONTROL__spidertron-enhancements-spidertron-patrol-pipette__ while selecting the spidertron.\nThe flashing number shows which waypoint is currently selected. __ALT_CONTROL__2__use-item__ will create a new waypoint after the currently selected one. __ALT_CONTROL__2__sp-replace-previous-waypoint__ will move the currently selected waypoint to the position specified.\nTo select a waypoint to insert-after/replace, click the [img=item.sp-spidertron-patrol-remote] button on that waypoint's row in the schedule GUI.\n\n__ALT_CONTROL__1__sp-delete-all-waypoints__ to delete all waypoints.\n__ALT_CONTROL__1__sp-toggle-spidertron-automatic-manual__ to toggle automatic/manual mode for the spidertron currently selected, opened, connected to held remote, or being driven.
sp-wait-conditions=Wait conditions can be set for each waypoint from the schedule GUI. They behave similarly to train wait conditions, but each waypoint can only have one wait condition. If you need to combine multiple wait conditions at one waypoint, you can often get a similar result by setting multiple waypoints at the same position, each with a different wait condition. Failing that, use a [font=default-semibold]Circuit condition[/font] wait condition and attach combinators to a [entity=sp-spidertron-dock] at that position.
sp-automatic-refueling=If a vehicle requires fuel, use the [font=default-semibold]Full fuel[/font] wait condition to prevent the vehicle from leaving a waypoint until it has been fully refuelled. There are two methods of automatic refuelling:\n\n- Configure a [entity=sp-spidertron-dock] to connect to the vehicle's "Fuel" inventory, then load fuel using inserters.\n- Add a logistic request for fuel on the vehicle directly, which will be supplied by [entity=logistic-robot]. Delivered fuel will be placed straight into the vehicle's fuel inventory. 
sp-aircraft-automation=Aircraft from [font=default-bold]Lex's Aircraft[/font] can also be automated using [item=sp-spidertron-patrol-remote] and [entity=sp-spidertron-dock].
sp-submarine-automation=Submarines from [font=default-bold]Maraxsis[/font] can also be automated using [item=sp-spidertron-patrol-remote] and [entity=sp-spidertron-dock].\nUse the [font=default-semibold]Submerge[/font] wait condition at a waypoint over a trench to enter/exit the trench.
